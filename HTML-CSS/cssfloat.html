            ********************Java Operators |******************** A programmer generally makes a program to perform some operation.

            For example, we can perform the addition of two numbers just by using  “+”  symbol in a program. Here, + is a symbol that performs an operation called addition. Such kind of symbol is called **************************Operators************************** in java .

            “An Operator in java is a symbol or a keyword that tells the compiler to perform a specific mathematical or logical operations.”

            They are used in programs to manipulate data and variables. They generally form mathematical or logical expressions. An expression is a combination of variable, constants, and operators.

            In Java, an expression has two parts: operand and operator. The variable or constant that operators act upon are called ******Operands.******
